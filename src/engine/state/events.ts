/**
 * Per-step EVENT BUFFER — the engine's one-way "what just happened" channel.
 *
 * `GameState.events` is filled during a `step()` (cleared at the very start of
 * each step) and drained by render/audio AFTER the step to drive transient juice
 * (damage numbers, hit flashes, screenshake, SFX, kill pops). It is:
 *
 *  - TRANSIENT: never persisted (`toSaveData` picks only progress/economy),
 *  - ONE-WAY: engine systems never READ it (events flow engine -> outside only),
 *  - DETERMINISTIC: same `(state, dt, input, seed)` produces the same event
 *    stream, so it is safe to leave inside the byte-compared state in tests.
 *
 * Payloads are intentionally tiny (ids, positions, amounts) so pushing one is a
 * single plain-object allocation per game moment.
