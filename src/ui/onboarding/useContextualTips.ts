/**
 * React-side glue for contextual tutorial hooks (M4.8 card A) — the
 * progressive-disclosure counterpart to `useOnboardingController.ts`. Same
 * shape: all DECISION logic is the pure `resolveTriggeredTip` from `./tips.ts`
 * — this hook never re-implements it. It owns exactly two side effects:
 *
 *  1. Hydrate the persisted "seen tip ids" list from localStorage once, post-
 *     mount (same reasoning as `readStoredFtueCompleted`'s mount-effect
 *     correction — localStorage isn't available during SSR).
 *  2. On every throttled snapshot change, diff against the previous snapshot
 *     and ask the pure resolver whether a not-yet-seen tip's trigger just
 *     fired; if so, hold its id in local state until `dismiss()` is called.
 *
 * `activeTipId` is deliberately local `useState`, NOT a global store field —
 * nothing else in the app needs to read "is a tip showing right now" (same
 * reasoning as `CodexPanel`'s local open/close state).
 *
 * Gated on `ftueCompleted`: tips must NEVER fire while the linear FTUE is
 * still running (`useOnboardingController.ts` only flips this to `true` once
 * the FTUE finishes naturally OR is skipped), and at most one tip is shown at
 * a time.
