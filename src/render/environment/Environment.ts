/**
 * Biome/background orchestrator — the `background` layer's sole owner.
 * Replaces the old static sky/ground fill with a live parallax scene that
 * crossfades to a new `BiomeScene` whenever the current ZONE (`zoneAt(
 * state.location)`, M6 "World & Town") resolves to a new biome slot
 * (`biomes.ts` `biomeForZone`) — town/farm-escalation/boss-room are each their
 * own themed biome per map, so walking to a new zone (or into the boss room)
 * naturally crossfades the whole scene, not just a raw stage-number change.
 *
 * Zone-change detection is a plain key comparison each `update()` (robust to
 * `zoneEntered`/`bossRoomEntered` AND any other way `state.location` could
 * jump, e.g. a fresh load) rather than depending on `frameEvents` alone.
 *
 * Motion here is real-seconds-based throughout (see `BiomeScene`/`ParallaxLayer`/
 * `AmbientField`) so the 1x/2x/3x game-speed multiplier never fast-forwards
 * the scenery — only the `battle`/`boss` PHASE (not speed) nudges the
 * "world travel" scroll pace, per the task spec.
